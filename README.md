# Personal-Medical-Charges-Prediction

**Project Status: Active**

#### Objective
In this project, we will be training a regression model on the "Insurance" dataset. The model is to predict the insurance costs for a person based on their age, sex, BMI (Body Mass Index), and more.

#### About Dataset
This dataset is contributed by Brett Lantz, the author of the textbook Machine Learning with R. The dataset can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv). The dataset has 1338 rows and 7 columns. It contains information about insurance beneficiaries and some data about them. Namely, the columns included in this dataset are:
- age
- sex
- bmi
- children
- region
- charges

#### Tools
- AWS SageMaker
- Python 3.9.15
- Jupyter
- Sci-Kit Learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
